Project 2 was written using JSX files to create a relatively unique version of the website—dynamically
changing the main block when clicking the navigation buttons.

The API connection was hardcoded in ritApi.js and is used by other files.

In the people section, I used the same card layout the professor demonstrated during the lecture. 
Each person has a dynamic card with user information and contact information.

For the page design theme, I used the official RIT website: 
https://www.rit.edu/brandportal/sites/rit.edu.brandportal/files/documents/RIT001_WebStyleGuide-05-31-2019-lr.pdf 
However, due to the large number of experiments, the styles.css looks cumbersome and sloppy, sorry about that.
